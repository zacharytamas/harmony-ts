# harmony-ts

This will be a very short-lived project because it will be superseded by OpenAI's official JavaScript version but as of today, 2025-08-06, it is not available yet. I have merely taken their Rust code and compiled it to WASM and made it usable via JavaScript.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.18. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
